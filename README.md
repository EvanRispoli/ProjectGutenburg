# ProjectGutenburg
## 2nd exercise from book Jb Ready Java

Like a modern Gutenberg, the System.out.println() method takes in information and prints it to the console terminal easily. We can print out whole books or even libraries this way. In this exercise, you again write text to the console.

NOTE
Random note: There are other printing methods too. System.out.print(), for example, takes in information does not also add a new line character. You can find more printing methods at docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/formatting.html.
